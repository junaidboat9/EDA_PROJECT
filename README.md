ðŸš€ From Data Exploration to Modeling: Student Performance Analysis

I recently conducted a comprehensive EDA on a student dataset to uncover insights into demographics, family background, lifestyle, and academic performance, and prepared it for predictive modeling.

ðŸ”¹ Steps I performed:

Checked data types & structure: Ensured each column was ready for analysis.

Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis: Explored distributions, relationships, and interactions among features.

Data Preparation for Modeling: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split to ensure reliable model evaluation.

ðŸ”¹ Key insights:

Family background, parental education, and lifestyle habits affect student performance.

Study habits and social activities have a noticeable correlation with grades.

ðŸ’¡ Tools used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
